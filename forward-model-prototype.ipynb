We calculate the simulated distribution of quasar colors at a given redshift and magnitude, following the procedures described in Fan (1999) and Fan et al. (2001a). The intrinsic quasar spectrum model includes a power-law continuum and a series of broad emission lines. We use the same distributions of the power-law index for the quasar continuum (α = 0.5 ± 0.3, fν ∝ ν-α) and the equivalent widths for the emission lines as in Fan (1999; except for Fe II, which now has a larger equivalent width). The synthetic quasar absorption spectrum takes into account intervening H I absorbers along the line of sight, including Lyα forest systems, Lyman-limit systems, and damped Lyα systems using distribution functions similar to those used by Fan (1999). Finally, we calculate the SDSS magnitudes and the associated photometric error from the model spectrum in each band using the filter transmission curves and system efficiency of Stoughton et al. (2002), assuming a median seeing of 1&farcs;4 FWHM. The simulated colors are generated for a uniformly distributed grid of redshift and i magnitude.\n",
